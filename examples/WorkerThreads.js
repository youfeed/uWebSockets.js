/* This example shows two different approaches to multi-core load balancing.
 * The first approach (the oldest) requires Linux and will only work on Linux.
 * This approach listens to port 4000 on all CPUs. That's it. That's all you do.
 * Listening to the same port from many worker threads will work on Linux.
 * The second approach will work on all platforms; you set up a main acceptorApp and register all child apps
 * (worker apps) with it. The acceptorApp will listen to port 9001 and move sockets in round-robin fashion to
 * the registered child apps.
 * Note that, in this example we only create 2 worker threads. Ideally you should create as many as there are CPUs
 * in your system. But by only creating 2 here, it is simple to see the perf. gain on a system of 4 cores, as you can then
 * run the client side on the remaining 2 cores without interfering with the server side. */
